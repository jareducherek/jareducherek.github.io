## [Dashboard Video Speed Prediction, Fall 2020](https://jareducherek.github.io/files/Driving_Segmentation.pdf)
For Digital Video Processing final, I implemented a transformer model for image segmentation
using raw camera footage of a car's dashboard camera.
<br>
Abstract:
<blockquote>
In this paper, we cover the motivation and approach for
accurate image segmentation from dashboard video. We
specifically focus on performance for the Comma10k dataset,
an open source dataset with 10,000 images with five separate
segmentation classes. A variety of semantic segmentation
architectures would perform well on this dataset, and
we discuss their differences. The performance for our model
of choice is compared to other public scores cited on the
Comma10k repo, including Comma10k baseline. We
cover important training and augmentation steps useful for
performance gains and ultimately show great performance
with contemporary transformer model Trans2Seg.

## [Dashboard Video Speed Prediction, Fall 2020](https://jareducherek.github.io/files/Speed_Prediction.pdf)
For Digital Image Processing final, I researched various methods for speed
regression from raw camera footage of a car's dashboard camera.
These methods span simple linear regression models to end-to-end deep learning frameworks.<br>
Abstract:
<blockquote>
In this paper, we cover several approaches for accurate speed prediction from
dashboard video. We specifically focus our
attention to providing a sound solution to the Comma AI
speed challenge [1]. We ultimately show great performance
with a simple approach involving sparse optical flow calculations and keypoint
detection derived from classical computer
vision algorithms. This performance is compared to results
obtained by replacin the classical algorithms with a deep
learning model. Additionally, we cover our attempts using
more sophisticated deep learning approaches that span topics
such as interest point detection, visual odometry, and dense
optical flow.
