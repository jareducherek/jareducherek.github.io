## Dashboard Video Speed Prediction, Fall 2020
For Digital Image Processing final, I researched various methods for speed
regression from raw camera footage of a car's dashboard camera.
These methods span simple linear regression models to end-to-end deep learning frameworks.

Abstract:
<blockquote>
In this paper, we cover several approaches for accurate speed prediction from
dashboard video. We specifically focus our
attention to providing a sound solution to the Comma AI
speed challenge [1]. We ultimately show great performance
with a simple approach involving sparse optical flow calculations and keypoint
detection derived from classical computer
vision algorithms. This performance is compared to results
obtained by replacin the classical algorithms with a deep
learning model. Additionally, we cover our attempts using
more sophisticated deep learning approaches that span topics
such as interest point detection, visual odometry, and dense
optical flow.
