This is the first body of work that has taken drillersâ€™ memos and converted them into activity codes, without the need for a human-classified training dataset.
The real-time classifier is very powerful in ensuring clean data at the source and will be particularly useful when implemented on reporting systems for classifying
rig activities by IADC activity codes. We further demonstrate the use of the classifier for cleansing historical datasets such that ILT analysis can be done more accurately.
