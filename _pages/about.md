# About Me
I am currently working as a data scientist for Boston Consulting Group.

I graduated in 2021 with my masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin.
I am passionate about all things engineering, and I enjoy learning about innovations that help improve our lives.
My current focus is to become proficient with techniques in data science and machine learning to do just that.
My hobbies include anything that keeps me physically active, primarily snowboarding, wake surfing, and hiking.
