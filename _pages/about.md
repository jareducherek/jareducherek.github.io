# About Me
I am currently in my second year of my Master's degree at The University of Texas at Austin,
where I am studying Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus on data science and machine learning.

I am passionate about all things engineering, and I enjoy learning about innovations that help improve our lives.
My current focus is to become proficient with techniques in data science and machine learning to do just that.
My hobbies include anything that keeps me physically active, primarily snowboarding, wake surfing, and hiking.
